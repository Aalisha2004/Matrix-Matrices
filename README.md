### ðŸ“‚ Files Overview

1. **`Matrices.java`**

   * **Purpose**: Basic matrix operations like creation, input, display, addition, and multiplication.
   * **Highlights**:

     * Demonstrates user input for matrices.
     * Includes methods for:

       * Matrix addition
       * Matrix multiplication
       * Displaying matrices

2. **`DiagonalSum.java`**

   * **Purpose**: Computes the sum of both primary and secondary diagonals of a square matrix.
   * **Highlights**:

     * Avoids double-counting the center element in odd-dimensional matrices.
     * Reads matrix elements from user input.

3. **`SortedMatrix.java`**

   * **Purpose**: Efficiently searches for an element in a sorted 2D matrix.
   * **Highlights**:

     * Matrix rows and columns are sorted in ascending order.
     * Uses a linear search from the top-right corner to find the target in O(m + n) time.

4. **`SpiralMatrix.java`**

   * **Purpose**: Prints a matrix in spiral (clockwise) order.
   * **Highlights**:

     * Accepts matrix input from the user.
     * Traverses layers of the matrix from the outside in.
